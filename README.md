# Text-RPG
An improved version of the Text-RPG I made back in 2021, this time in Python and with much more functionality!

This is a new attempt at the same formula I did ~2 years ago in C#, being a cyclical text-based RPG. I've since learned a lot more about coding techniques and practices in general, so I'm trying to make this a far superior version of that old C# one. I have yet to finish it as of writing, but I'm still passionate about working on it and add more to it every day.
